# BumperShapes

Here's the challenge. At the top of the screen three random figures will appear, each with a random shape and color. Within one second, the user must tap a figure (the same or different) to change either its shape or color. Then it falls. After it falls, any figures with the same shape will multiply, any with the same color will disappear. The game is over when the figures pile up to the top.
